## 📂 Tasks Overview  

| Task No. | Task Name | Description | Expected Output |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Understanding & Exploring Data Bias** | Identify biases in AI models. Example: Ask ChatGPT to generate text about a left-handed person. Find more biases in LLMs and note them down. | A list of biases found in AI-generated responses. |
| 2️⃣ | **Data Cleaning & Exploration** | Identify biases in the Customer Churn dataset. Detect and document potential biased data points. | A list of columns causing bias in the dataset. |
| 3️⃣ | **Customer Segmentation** | Group customers based on demographics, geography, or usage behavior. | Segmented customer groups, visualized with charts. |
| 4️⃣ | **Identify Customer Churn Indicators** | Analyze the dataset to find features strongly correlated with churn. | A list of top predictors of customer churn. |
