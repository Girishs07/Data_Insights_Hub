# 📊 Life Expectancy Chart  

## 📝 Description  
This task involves creating a **Line Chart** in Excel to visualize the **change in Average Life Expectancy over the years**. The chart will help analyze trends and understand how life expectancy has evolved over time.  

## 🎯 Expected Output  
- **X-axis:** Average Life Expectancy  
- **Y-axis:** Year  
- A **clear line chart** showing the trend of life expectancy over different years.  

## 📂 Files Included  
- **`dataset.csv`** → The dataset containing the required data.  
- **`chart_screenshot.png`** → Screenshot of the final chart for reference.  
- **`life_expectancy_chart.xlsx`** → Excel file with the created chart.  
- **`analysis_notebook.ipynb`** → (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for any additional analysis.  

## 🛠️ Steps to Create the Chart  
1. **Open Excel** and import the dataset (`dataset.csv`).  
2. Select the **Year** column for the Y-axis and **Average Life Expectancy** for the X-axis.  
3. Insert a **Line Chart** using the Excel toolbar.  
4. Format the chart (add title, labels, and adjust the axis if necessary).  
5. Save the file as `life_expectancy_chart.xlsx`.  
6. Take a screenshot of the chart and include it in the repository (`chart_screenshot.png`).  

## 📈 Insights  
- Identify patterns in life expectancy over time.  
- Observe any significant dips or rises and relate them to historical events.
